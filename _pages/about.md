Welcome to my AIML portfolio. Here, I bring together my passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning. It's a platform where I showcase my projects, share my journey, and explore the endless possibilities of AI and ML.

### I love building:
- Machine learning models
- End-to-end data science workflows

### Tools I use:
- Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- Streamlit, Jupyter Notebooks


I’m actively looking for opportunities in AI/ML and Data Science.  
Let’s connect!
